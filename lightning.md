# When to use Lightning?

Lightning makes things easier and abstracts the details. In research (or in edge cases), you might need to go deeper. For example, `torch.compile`, custom metrics, etc.

- üìù **Incentives** - compete with AnyScale, Ray, SkyPilot (multi-cloud, recommended)
- üöÄ **Risk** - Need to be careful relying on venture capital-backed code (ideal customer profile may be different, may need to pivot, short runway and high return expectations from LPs)
- **üîç Research** - usually need to use algorithms like HyperBand and use fully-sharded data parallel models for best performance. Supported in Ray and SkyPilot, work-in-progress for Lightning.
- **üî• Time Horizon** - behavior change is hard. Your future self will thank you but need to learn by experience when to use a shortcut / abstraction versus when to use the details. For me, I need to see the details almost always (not assembly/CUDA regularly though!)

# Incentives

"Writing a training loop is not that hard; why use a library?"

* Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure - all competing for mindshare
* If you reduce your cognitive load, you give up mindshare in exchange for "efficiency". 
* It is up to you to decide when this trade-off is worth it.
* For me, it rarely is: libraries move fast, and I need to understand the details to be able to debug and optimize.
